\begin{abstract}
This project is a quantum version of the classic game Master Mind played by two players. Given \textit{n} different colors, the first player – the keeper, secretly forms a sequence of \textit{n} colored pins, where several pins may share the same color or all of them may be of different colors. The task of the second player – the guesser, to disclose the hidden sequence with minimal guesses.

This project works with the following version (\textbf{version 2}): each guess is graded by the keeper with a single digit – the number of correct
pins in their correct positions. The game stops when the grade of the most recent guess is \textit{n}.
