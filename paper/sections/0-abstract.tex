This project is a quantum version of the classic game Master Mind played by two players. Given 2 different colors, the first player – the keeper, secretly forms a sequence of \textit{n} colored pins, where several may share the same color. The task of the second player – the guesser, to disclose the hidden sequence with minimal guesses.

This project works with the following version (\textbf{version 2}): each guess is graded by the keeper with a single digit – the number of correct
pins in their correct positions. The game stops when the grade of the most recent guess is \textit{n}.

Given a guess sequence $g$ of size $n$ and the grade $s$ from the keeper, the given algorithms and steps will produce the next guess efficiently.
