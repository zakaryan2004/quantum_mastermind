\section{Quantum System}

\subsection*{Suggest a system of qubits that describes the game, and define the game states and state vectors.}

Let $n$ be the length of the sequence in the game. We will keep $n$ qubits describing our guess, $n$ auxiliary qubits storing the XOR results and the Hamming distances, and some auxiliary qubits for interim calculations.

\subsection*{Initialization of the state and state vectors}

Start with \( n \) qubits in the state \( \ket{0} \) and additional auxiliary qubits as required.

\[
\ket{0}^{\otimes n} \otimes \ket{0}^{\otimes n}
\]

\subsection*{Create Superposition}

Apply Hadamard gates to the first \( n \) qubits to create an equal superposition of all possible \( n \)-bit states:

\[
H^{\otimes n} \ket{0}^{\otimes n} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2^n}} \sum_{x=0}^{2^n-1} \ket{x}
\]

\[
\Qcircuit @C=1em @R=1em {
\lstick{\ket{0}} & \gate{H} & \qw \\
\lstick{\ket{0}} & \gate{H} & \qw \\
\lstick{\ket{0}} & \gate{H} & \qw \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots \\
\lstick{\ket{0}} & \gate{H} & \qw \\
}
\]
